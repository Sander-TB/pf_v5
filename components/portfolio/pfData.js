			"A project for school where we were tasked to display some info about SpaceX from their API.",

		goal: "Build a microsite for SpaceX or NASA. This should focus on space technology. A microsite is a branded, self-contained site, usually on a its own domain, with a single purpose and a limited number of pages. The purpose can be promotional or editorial, and be may linked to a specific event or period of time. A microsite is usually built as an addition to an existing brand website.",
		notes:
			"For the first go-around of this project, we were to make it using vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. I decided to try and remake it after I had learned the basics of React. I also made some adjustments to the original design, and this time I decided to use Sass for styling, as opposed to regular CSS.",
